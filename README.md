## About

Tabclip is a web browser extension for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome that allows you to copy browser tabs to (or create them from) your clipboard.

The "Copy" button, or keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+C by default, copies tab URLs to your clipboard.

The "Paste" button, or keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+V by default, attempts to find all URLs that appear in your clipboard, then opens each URL in a new browser tab.

That's it!

## Feedback

If you have suggestions or bug reports for tabclip, I am much more likely to see your feedback if you leave it at [tabclip's GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/joshdick/tabclip/issues) rather than on tabclip's Firefox Add-Ons or Chrome Web Store pages.

I'd like to keep this extension as simple and minimal as possible, so most feature requests are not likely to be honored.

## Development

To build tabclip for both Firefox and Chrome, install the latest versions of NodeJS and `npm`, then do the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshdick/tabclip.git
cd tabclip
npm install
npx webpack
```

The build will create a `tabclip.zip` extension archive in the `dist/` directory.

## Attribution

Tabclip is heavily inspired by Vincent Par√©'s ["Copy All Urls" Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-all-urls/djdmadneanknadilpjiknlnanaolmbfk). I created tabclip because I wanted a similar extension that looked and worked the same in both Chrome and Firefox. Tabclip was written from scratch and shares no code with the "Copy All Urls" Chrome extension.
